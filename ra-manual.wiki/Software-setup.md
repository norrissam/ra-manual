Below are links to installing and setting up the software we will commonly use (whether you are on a PC or a Mac), along with links to useful software manuals:


### Software installs
#### GitHub
We use GitHub for task management and software version control. Send your GitHub username to the group member in charge of setting up the GitHub repository, so that you can be added.
If you have not used GitHub before, [join GitHub](https://github.com/join) and also either [install GitHub desktop](https://desktop.github.com/) or [install Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads) ([Git for Windows](https://git-for-windows.github.io/) here). You should also install [git-lfs](https://git-lfs.github.com/), which we will use to sync output files (typically pdfs) through GitHub.

Resources for learning git and GitHub workflow:

- [git-lfs additional info](https://github.com/blog/2079-managing-large-files-with-git-lfs), including GitHub desktop implementation.


#### Slack
We use [Slack](https://slack.com/) for: (1) brief communications and questions that can be easily resolved without creating a formal GitHub issue; and (2) recording meeting notes.

#### Dropbox
Data is stored in Dropbox. You should have a paid account.

#### Latex
We write papers in latex. You will need a latex compiler from [MikTex](https://miktex.org/) as well as a text editor that integrates with MikTex. [TeXstudio](http://www.texstudio.org/) and [WinEdt](http://www.winedt.com/) are two options, among others, you might consider.

#### Stata
When possible, data analysis will be done in [Stata](http://www.stata.com/). A university license may be available, or you can [order Stata directly](http://www.stata.com/order/).

#### Python
Python is a flexible programming language with many uses. We use it principally for scraping and parsing.
