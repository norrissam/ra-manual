This section applies to RAs planning to apply to PhD programs.

### Overview
Top PhD programs want to admit candidates who will (i) perform well in the coursework in their program and (ii) excel in independent research.

The primary way of evaluating (i) is to look at the history of courses the candidate has taken. At a minimum, this should include good performance in undergraduate-level proof-based mathematics courses (e.g., real analysis, linear algebra). At best, it will include good performance in challenging PhD-level economics courses at a top school.

The primary way of evaluating (ii) is through letters of recommendation. The best letters are from well-recognized faculty at top institutions and speak not only to the candidate’s proficiency in research tasks but also to their creativity in developing and executing independent research ideas. The best candidates can supplement these letters with concrete independent research, from an undergraduate thesis or other independent project.

During your time as an RA you can improve how PhD programs will evaluate you on both of these dimensions. It is my job to design the work you do as an RA to ensure that, in addition to getting my own work done, I also put myself in a good position to evaluate your research skills in my letter.

The rest is largely up to you. However, I can contribute to the other aspects of your application by advising you on courses, providing feedback on application materials, and giving you guidance on independent research. In addition, my letter will allow me to make credible statements about “softer” elements of your application, such as the quality of independent research you have done.

### Quarterly review
At the end of each academic quarter, we will have a meeting to discuss:
* RA work.
* Classes.
* Your research.
* Other decisions/issues related to your application.
You are responsible for scheduling this meeting. Please e-mail me by week 9 of the quarter to schedule the meeting. When you e-mail, please include the following information in your e-mail:
* Grades from any courses you have taken at Chicago or other institutions in previous quarters.
* A list of courses taken in the current quarter with whatever information you have on grade outcomes (exam grades, problem set grades, etc.)
* A brief summary of the main areas of RA work you have been involved in over the past quarter.
* An outline of any other issues you wish to discuss regarding your progress.

Note that these meetings are meant to guarantee a minimum to the frequency of our interactions on the topics listed above, not a maximum. I am always happy to discuss aspects of your progress.

After the meeting, please email to me a brief summary of what we discussed. I will write back and confirm or amend your understanding as needed. This way, we can be sure to stay on the same page.

### Preparing your application
Below is a list of the elements of your application that it will be useful for me to know about. Adhering to the deadlines below will allow me to write the strongest possible letter for you and to give you informed and timely advice on other aspects of your application. Ultimately, of course, it is your application, and (with the exception of deadlines for recommendation letters) you are free to ignore these suggestions.

* _Intermediate Summary_. By September 15 of the year in which you are applying, please send me the following information so that I can provide feedback:
  * A spreadsheet listing the top 50 economics PhD programs along with an indication of whether you plan to apply to each program and any notes you have on the reasons for your decision. You can use the [US News and World Report](https://www.usnews.com/best-graduate-schools/top-humanities-schools/economics-rankings) list as a starting point. Depending on your interests, you may also want to include top programs in agricultural / resource / environmental economics, top public policy programs, and top business schools offering PhD programs.
  * A draft of your personal/research statement.

* _Final Summary_. By September 30 of the year in which you are applying, please send me the following information:
  * A list of the programs to which you are applying, along with the deadlines for recommendation letters for each program.
  * A list of people writing letters for you.
  * Final transcripts from undergraduate and any other courses you have taken.
  * A draft of your personal statement and any other essay materials you will be submitting with your applications.
  * A draft of your CV.
  * A list of what you see as your most impressive accomplishments in your RA work.
  * A list of the main things you think you’ve learned / main ways in which you’ve improved in your RA work.
  * When you send me these materials, you should also schedule a meeting so that we can have a final conversation about your application.
* _Ongoing_. After September 30 please keep me posted in real time on:
  * Any exam or course grades for courses in which you are enrolled in the fall quarter of the year in which you are applying.
  * Any other new information that you think might be relevant for my letter.
  * Any program decisions (acceptances/rejections) that you receive.
